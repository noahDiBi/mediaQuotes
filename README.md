Final Project for Platform Computing CSC2053

Project Summary
It is very easy to almost remember a quote from a book or a movie, but then mess it up a little bit. Our application aims to help people find the quotes they are looking for, whether they are trying to send a humorous text to a friend or quote a book/movie for an assignment. Given a word or a phrase, our application will return quotes that have that word/phrase within the selected TV series and/or book(s).

From https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#food--drink, we found a collection of free public APIs used in software development. The APIs we are aiming to use for this project are the Dune (quotes from the book, not the movie), Game of Thrones Quotes, Breaking Bad Quotes (which includes quotes from Better Call Saul, too), and Lucifer Quotes. At first, the user will be prompted to choose which TV series or book they want to search for. Then, they will enter a word or phrase they are looking for. The application will return the matching quotes, with additional information if included in the APIs we are taking the data from.

Planned Technologies
We plan on using our knowledge for API usage from class time to execute our project, such as extracting data from JSON files and using server request methods, as well as general Android app development knowledge, such as designing the layout with views and multiple screens. Incorporation of images will also be utilized. Git will be utilized for version control between group members.
